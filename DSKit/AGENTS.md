# Agent Instructions

## Purpose
- DSKit is the Swift Package source for the design system library used by DSKitExplorer and MNews.

## Structure
- `Sources/DSKit/Views`: reusable SwiftUI components.
- `Sources/DSKit/Modifiers`: DSKit view modifiers.
- `Sources/DSKit/Appearances`: theme/appearance definitions.
- `Sources/DSKit/Designable`, `Fonts`, `Helpers`: supporting types.

## Integration Points
- Built as `DSKit.framework` by `DSKitExplorer.xcodeproj`.
- Embedded into MNews when using `../imodeveloperlab/Workspace.xcworkspace`.

## Conventions / Pitfalls
- Keep components deterministic for snapshot tests.
- Many docs in `Content/` depend on snapshots generated by tests.

## Run / Test in Isolation
- Run snapshot tests via `DSKitExplorer` scheme (includes DSKitTests in the test plan).
